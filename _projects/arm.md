Most of the rescue robots are required to perform tasks in real disaster sites, which demand accurate, light weight and soft-controlled manipulators. Object manipulation, dexterity actions and target detection are the most critical required tasks. To that end, a 6-DOF 2-link manipulator is designed and implemented in Advanced Mobile Robotics Laboratory by a group of mechanical and electrical engineers. The 2-link robotic arm enables users to manipulate objects and detect particular parameters as the most critical tasks in the environment with complete safety, freedom, and effectiveness. Each of the degrees of freedomâ€™s link is independently removable, and easy-to-replace with another equipment in order to perform different tasks. Its main structure, is entirely made of Aluminum and Carbon fiber, delivers optimal robustness and durability as well as a cutting-edge look-and-feel. It is equipped with a gripper, consist of 2 jaw-opening fingers that coupled to each other. It has friction pads which allow the fingers to adjust to any object whatever its shape. In addition, an ARM-based board is developed to control the servo motors by getting position and velocity feedback and sending commands in RS-485 bus and communicate the information with control station by Ethernet.
