Karo is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), equipped with a dexterous robotic arm, which is designed and implemented with functions of mobility, manipulation, mapping, and inspection in areas that are inaccessible or too dangerous for people. This tele-operative robot easily climbs and descends, stairs and slopes efficiently. It can overcome obstacles and debris to perform reconnaissance, dispose of bombs, rescue and inspection with a high level of accuracy and controllability. High-resolution camera, night vision, infra-red vision, precise sensor systems, and full-duplex audio interface are provided for the inspection system. It tele-communicates collected information of targets to the control station simultaneously. Karo can be supplied in various user-specified configurations.
