The biggest challenge with response robots is embedding all mobility, dexterity, and reconnaissance capabilities in a single robot. We designed and implemented Karo ---a tele-operative response robot--- that exhibits a high degree of mobility at the side of maintaining required dexterity and exploration capabilities for urban search and rescue (USAR) missions.

Karo can be perceived as an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that has a dexterous robotic arm and is able to perform high mobility, manipulation, mapping, and inspection in areas that are inaccessible or too dangerous for people. We developed Karo based on the system requirements of a standard rescue robot from the frameworks of [Rescue Robot League](https://rrl.robocup.org/) (RRL) of [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/) competitions. Karo easily climbs and descends, stairs and slopes using the tracked locomotion system and performs reconnaissance, rescue and inspection task while maintaining the stability on those obstacles.

Our team at [AMRL](https://mrl-amrl.ir/) implemented the command and control system with a customized power system, sensors, and hardware systems that fits the robot's requirements. We equipped Karo's inspection system with high-resolution cameras, night vision, infra-red vision, precise sensor systems, and full-duplex audio interface. Karo benefits from our own software system and human–robot interface that enables the operator to remotely operate the robot and have a bi-directional communication with the environment.

Our team started this project in 2015. We undertook extensive evaluations of Karo’s field performance at RRL’s test suites and training suites of a fire department to make sure it meets the principal objective of a response robot. Here is the first version of Karo:
