I am a second-year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech, and a research assistant at [Collab](https://collab.me.vt.edu/) under the supervision Prof. [Dylan Losey](https://dylanlosey.com/). My research interests include robot learning, human-robot teams, and artificial intelligence.

Previously, I had the honor to work with Prof. [Keith Buffinton](https://www.bucknell.edu/fac-staff/keith-buffinton) at Bucknell University, where I received my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. My research, which was a cooperative project with the University of Michigan and funded by [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/), focused on modeling and control of a flexible soft actuator for creating soft robotic arms.

I received my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Qazvin Azad University in 2015. From 2011 to 2017, I was a research assistant and a leader in the robotic team at [AMRL](https://mrl-amrl.ir/). I focused on design and implementation of tele-operative response robots. Our team actively participated in [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/) and was steadily ranked within the top 3 in [Rescue Robot League](https://rrl.robocup.org/) organized by [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/standard-test-methods-response-robots).
